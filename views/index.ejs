<h2>What is Front-End Web Development?</h2>

<br>
<h2>Tools Used</h2>
<p>There are are multiple different tools and platforms that can be used to develop the front end of a website.</p>

<h3>Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML)</h3>
<p>HTML is the backbone for all webpages. It provides the overall framework for how the website will look.</p>

<h3>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</h3>
<p>CSS is what makes the website look visually appealing. It maintains style sheets that sit on top of other style rules.</p>
